# Shop Smart
Spend less time at the grocery story and more time with family and friends! With Shop Smart allows you and your family/friends to save time and shop more efficiently. The web application updates in realtime to let each other know what is already bought and needs to be bought. Users can also add new items, edit existing items, and delete items from the checklist.

## Dependencies
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, BCrypt, Socket.io, QUnit

## Instructions
Before anything, run `npm install` to install Node. To run the program locally, run ``node server.js`` in your command line and navigate to the port. 

## Technologies
This is a full stack application built using Javascript frameworks and libraries. I used jQuery to simplify development and streamline the process. In the backend, I used Node.js with Express to run our application with MongoDB as our database. In terms of styling, I used a Bootstrap template but customized it to the application's needs. Also included a few Bootstrap components such as cards, forms, and breadcrumb.

## If I had more time...
I would create more features for the application to enhance user experience. These feature would include creating a private list with the option to invite others, allow the sorting of items with the option to set the priority level, and assign each item to a specific user. I would also make the web application mobile friendly to enhance usability.
